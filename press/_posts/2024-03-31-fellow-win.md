#  Announcing the Winners of the 2024 Chevron FAB STEM Fellowship

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**


**March 31, 2024 - Boston, MA —** In 2023, Chevron and the Fab Foundation launched the **Chevron FAB STEM Fellowship**, a commitment to equity, inclusion, and the advancement of STEM education on a global scale. This one-year discovery program is designed to empower outstanding educators in the pursuit of innovative and inclusive STEM teaching practices while engaging new and under-represented student populations in STEM education. After a highly successful pilot year, in which two Fellows were selected—Nathan Pritchett from Fab Lab Tulsa and Pieter Verduijn from the International School of Aruba—the program was expanded in 2024 to include four Fellows. 

**We’re thrilled to announce the winners of the 2024 Chevron FAB STEM Fellowship:**
- **Angel Johnson**, Director of Fab Lab Miami (Florida, USA) 
- **Dr. Ann Marie Macara**, Biology Teacher at Wildwood School (California, USA) 
- **Ilyes Tlili**, Manager of Fab Lab Mahdia (Mahdia, Tunisia)
- **Julie Sundar**, Manager of IoT Lab Suriname (Paramaribo, Suriname)

Each selected Fellow receives a $10,000 stipend, a demonstration of Chevron's commitment to facilitating the global exchange of knowledge. Over the course of the year, the four Fellows will travel the world, visiting multiple Fab Labs across the international network to partner with their colleagues in the development of inclusive STEM practices. Together, they will create new, collaborative STEM lesson content for K-12 education environments. Upon returning home, Fellows will share their experiences and newfound knowledge with the global community in the form of published blog posts, podcast interviews, and presentations at conferences and education events throughout the following year. This immersive experience is designed to enrich the Fellows' understanding of diverse educational contexts and foster collaborative learning throughout an expansive international community.

This year, more than 75 educators—from across the US, Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia—applied to become Fellows. In addition to the four recipients of the Fellowship, nine applicants received honorable mention: Dr. Alandra Kahl (USA), Aminu Bonifacio (Ghana), Gregory Keoki Kent (Hawaii, USA), Isaac Regier (USA), John Rexford Nzira (Tanzania), Kayla Bowman (USA), Kristin Burress (USA), Lora Taylor (USA), Oscar Díaz (Mexico). Five experts in digital fabrication, education, and STEM outreach made up the panel of judges: Karen M. Rawls, Senior Social Investment Advisor at Chevron; Rodney Williams, Program Manager for Education & Outreach at the Fab Foundation; Duaa Alaali, Fab Lab Manager & STEM Educational Initiative Specialist at Fab Lab Bahrain; Iván Sánchez Milara, Instructor at Fab Lab Oulu; and Nathan Pritchett, Executive Director at Fab Lab Tulsa and 2023 Chevron Fab STEM Fellow.

Chevron has supported Fab Labs and the maker movement, promoting STEM education for more than a decade. This partnership has resulted in a robust network of impactful and educational Fab Labs, engaging over 100,000 students and community members across Chevron’s U.S-based operations. The **Chevron FAB STEM Fellowship** further contributes to the advancement of STEM education, fostering a culture of innovation and inclusivity in classrooms and after-school programs around the world.
