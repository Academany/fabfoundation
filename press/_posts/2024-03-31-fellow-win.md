#  Announcing the Winners of the 2024 Chevron FAB STEM Fellowship

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**


**March 31, 2024 - Boston, MA —** In 2023, Chevron and the Fab Foundation launched the **Chevron FAB STEM Fellowship**, a commitment to equity, inclusion, and the advancement of STEM education on a global scale. This one-year discovery program is designed to empower outstanding educators in the pursuit of innovative and inclusive STEM teaching practices while engaging new and under-represented student populations in STEM education. After a highly successful pilot year, in which two Fellows were selected—Nathan Pritchett from Fab Lab Tulsa and Pieter Verduijn from the International School of Aruba—the program was expanded in 2024 to include four Fellows.
