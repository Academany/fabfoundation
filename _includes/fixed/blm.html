        <p>
        In the past weeks, the murders of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshard Brooks in Georgia, and George Floyd in Minnesota have made it clear that systemic racism must be faced, and violence against Black people must end. While recent events have highlighted this fact, we recognize that this is not new, and there is much work to be done.
        </p>

        <p>
        It’s a fact that African-Americans have been, and continue to be subjected to discrimination, violence, and unequal treatment. Racism is a stain on our society and we must confront it head on.
        </p>

        <p>
        As a global community, we recognize that this extends beyond the United States, and recognize our colleagues around the world who are standing in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The Fab Foundation vehemently denounces racism in all its forms and loudly declares that Black Lives Matter.
        </p>

        <p>
        As an organization and a network we will listen to learn, and we will use our energy, resources, and technology as tools to support equity, justice, inclusion and economic opportunity.  
        </p>

        <p>
        Fab Foundation will be a force for progress.
