It's National Engineers Week and we are celebrating by launching the new SCOPES-DF website!

[SCOPESDF.org](https://www.scopesdf.org/) is dedicated to educators working with primary and secondary school students who want to leverage digital fabrication for STEM learning.

Scaling a Community of Practice for Education in STEM through Digital Fabrication (SCOPES-DF) is our answer to the call for quality, standards-aligned, digital fabrication curriculum. The goal is to develop a community of practice to learn with and from as we use digital fabrication to ignite student learning.

Today we invite you to visit [www.scopesdf.org](https://www.scopesdf.org/) where you can:

1. Register, create a profile, and join this emerging community dedicated to learning.

2. Share lessons and activities that you’ve created for primary and secondary level students.

3. Download and use lessons created by the rest of the community to ignite learning in your classroom, fab lab or makerspace.

And please spread the word! Share [www.scopesdf.org](https://www.scopesdf.org/) with others, follow us on social media @FabFndn across all platforms – help us build and support this growing community of practice.

Extra! Extra!

Don't miss the debut of our SCOPES-DF Playbook, which will go to subscribers Friday,

February 22nd, bookending the EWeek celebration. So register with scopesdf.org today!

It’s great to join [EWeek](https://www.nspe.org/resources/partners-and-state-societies/national-engineers-week) this year as we celebrate engineering and STEM.

And a special thank you to our sponsors, [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/corporate-responsibility) and [GE Foundation](https://www.ge.com/sustainability/philanthropy).
