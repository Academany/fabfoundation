**Chevron and the Fab Foundation were thrilled to sponsor a visit to Cleveland area Fab Labs and makerspaces by Adam Savage, Former Co-Host of “MythBusters” in order to promote innovation and making.**


Sonya Pryor-Jones, the Fab Foundation’s Chief Implementation Officer, was instrumental in arranging the details of the visit which included stops at the Elizabeth Forward School District, the Intermediate Unit 1 Fab Lab, the Carnegie Science Center Fab Lab, Carnegie Mellon’s IDeATe@Hunt, University of Pittsburgh’s Human Engineering Research Laboratories, 7800 Susquehanna, and the Children’s Museum Pittsburgh’s early childhood makerspace.

The Fab Foundation is pleased to announce that Adam’s recent visit to Pittsburgh is part of a national tour of 6 Maker Cities in the USA. The tour is designed to visit and document innovation in education, entrepreneurship, and workforce development. Sponsorship is provided by Chevron, as part of the energy company’s continuing commitment to STEM education. Started in response to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy “Maker Initiative,” Mr. Savage aims to engage and excite the communities he visits and then document the tour on video for the entire country to share in the experience via multiple media channels, including Tested.com. He will visit a variety of fab labs, makerspaces, hackerspaces and innovative makers in each community. Stay tuned!
