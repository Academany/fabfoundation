2020 Teacher Innovator Award- nominate someone now\!

Since 2016, Chevron and the Fab Foundation have partnered to recognize educators that are creating STEM learning opportunities through digital fabrication.\_To date, we have awarded over $40,000 to formal and informal educators all around the world. 

This year is a particularly challenging time for educators and their students. Due to the pandemic, over 95% of school-age children are unable to learn in their classrooms with teachers. In spite of these difficulties, many teachers are innovating and finding a way to get quality learning experiences to their students, and we want to acknowledge them with the Teacher Innovator Award! 

We will be accepting submissions for the 2020 Teacher Innovator Award throughout the month of May (Teacher Appreciation Month!), beginning May 5. Apply below and find out more!
