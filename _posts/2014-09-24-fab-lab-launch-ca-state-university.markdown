## Chevron Grant Provides Access to Cutting-Edge Tools for STEM Education

Cambridge, MA – Sept. 24, 2014 – The Fab Foundation today announced the opening of a Digital Fabrication Laboratory (Fab Lab) at California State University Bakersfield’s [CSUB] School of Natural Science, Mathematics and Engineering. The Fab Lab, made possible by a generous grant from Chevron, offers hands-on, project-based learning opportunities to the community, with particular emphasis on STEM education for students in grades K – 12.

Like the more than 400 facilities in the Fab Lab Network, the CSUB Fab Lab, is centered around a suite of digital fabrication tools and prototyping machines such as laser cutters, 3D Printers, and milling machines, used for “Making (almost) Anything”. It is the first of ten Fab Labs that Chevron is bringing to areas where the company operates as a result of the energy company’s strong commitment to communities and STEM education in particular.

“We are excited to partner with these world-class organizations to open this state-of-the-art Fab Lab here at CSUB,” elaborates Blair Blackwell, manager of corporate education programs at Chevron. “Investing in STEM is a national imperative and we at Chevron are dedicated to working with our partners to provide cutting-edge tools that foster innovation for the benefit of K-12 students around the country.”

Dr. Anne Houtman, Dean of the School of Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering at CSUB explains: “CSUB has been a center for STEM education in Kern County for almost half a century. The debut of the Fab Lab at CSUB highlights our continued commitment to lifelong learning for better lives and better careers.”

The Fab Foundation supports Fab Labs worldwide in a wide range of projects that foster and accelerate education, innovation, entrepreneurship, business development and community building. Director Sherry Lassiter says, “We are thrilled to now have a Fab Lab in the California State University system where there will be far-reaching impact. Our collaboration with Chevron allows the new Fab Labs coming online to start out fully equipped for success.”

A grand opening and ribbon cutting will take place on Wednesday, September 24 at 4 p.m. at the new Fab Lab.
