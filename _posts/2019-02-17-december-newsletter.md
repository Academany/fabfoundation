# Fab Foundation

# December 2018 Newsletter

## 1,600 Fab Labs Worldwide!


The Fab Lab network continues to grow and make impact across the world! As 2018 comes to a close,

our network numbers more than 1,600 Fab Labs in 100+ countries and, if Lass's Law holds true, we aniticpate that this number will double by mid2020.

The Fablabs.io platform hosts the main list of all Fab

Labs around the world. If you know of a Fab Lab that is not yet registered on the platform and would like

to be part of the #FabLabNetwork please make sure they register here!

As you may have noticed, fablabs.io has a terrific new look and feel. We want to give special thanks to

the Fab Lab Barcelona Team for their great effort on the development and launch of the new website.

Stay tuned…more changes are coming!

## A NEW PARTNERSHIP

We are happy to announce that the Fab Foundation is partnering with Terre des hommes, a humanitarian organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. TDH focusses on helping children and youth at risk due to migration, war, work or natural disaster, in big cities, rural communities or even gold mines, to improve education, protection, health and children's rights.

TDH and Fab Foundation are working together to develop fab labs for these at risk communities, and developing ways in which fab labs, technology, and community can improve the lives and livelihoods of children and youth around the world.

In 2017, 44,000 people were newly displaced every day. The average time people spend ‘away from home’ is a staggering 18(!) years for many of us that would be half of our lives lived elsewhere.

We will be reaching out to the fab lab community this year to find labs willing to technically support and mentor the new TDH labs. If you want to help out, or have ideas about how to leverage fab labs and their tools for at risk youth, please contact jeanmichel.molenaar@tdh.ch or go to www.tdh.ch to learn more!

## THE FAB CITY FOUNDATION

Next step towards the future of Fab City

Since 2014, Fab City Global Initiative has been collaboratively building the roadmap toward self sufficient, locally productive yet globally connected cities. We often say that we're building the airplane at the same time as flying it, using our prototyping approach to test and develop the productive power of cities and citizens.

2018 has been a year of milestones that have strengthened many aspects of the Fab City Global Initiative. This year we hosted the largest Fab City summit yet, brining together over 1000 people from 80 different countries to explore Fab City thinking. At Paris' Hotel du Ville, with the Mayor of Paris, Mayor of Barcelona and the Fab Foundation's Sherry Lassiter in attendance, we signed the Fab City Manifesto and published the first Fab City book. 2018 also marked the year that the Fab City Foundation was established. The Fab City Foundation is a big step forward for the global initiative because it will help to articulate the goals and disseminate the knowledge of the Fab City research roadmap as well as leverage the extensive e-governance, financial technologies and online business efficacy of Estonia, the country where Fab City Foundation is established.

The official launch event of the Fab City Foundation just took place in Estonia on December 12, 2018.

## FAB FOUNDATION FORUM

With this newsletter, the Fab Foundation Forum initiative is officially launched! Our main goals are to:

Facilitate communication, sharing and collaboration between regional networks, and by extension, between fab labs and fabbers around the world.

Gather and distribute resources and data from the Fab Lab Network that can help those looking to start new labs, or to enhance the operations, sustainability and fundraising capacity of existing labs.

Develop a unified strategy for promoting and communicating about the Fab Lab Network that enables individual labs to identify themselves as members of an international network of likeminded organizations with internal resources and governance.

We'll hit the ground running in January with the 2019 FabCensus and our first recurring monthly call, open to representatives from regional networks worldwide. In the meantime, reach out and connect with the FFF team through forum@fabfoundation.org.

## SHARE YOUR FAB STORIES WITH THE WORLD!

It's hard to believe, but The Fab Foundation's 10th year anniversary is coming up in February, 2019! Over the last 10 years + we've seen the growth of the Fab Lab network to more than 1600 labs, we've seen the growth of Fab Academy, Fab City, FabLat Kids, FabCoin, FABx and much more. This global network is changing the way we design, create, invent, produce and make impact every day. As part of our 10th year celebration we want to communicate YOUR stories to the world. We'll be celebrating of the network's growth and impact through a 10th Year Anniversary Fab Foundation Publication tentatively entitled "10 N 10", featuring ten great stories of impact and vision from the network.

This is a call to the network to share the story of your fab lab building community, making impact, taking part in this global initiative and changing the world. If you would like us to consider your story as part of the 10 N 10 publication next year, please read and complete the following form [HERE](https://form.jotformz.com/82757379572675).
