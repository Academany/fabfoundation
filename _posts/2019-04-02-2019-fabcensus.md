Fabbers- Help us map the current state of the Fab Lab Network by taking a quick survey by April 12, 2019!

Fab Foundation Forum, in its effort to better understand and respond to the needs of the rapidly growing Fab Lab Network, is looking to gather as much information as possible on all active labs and regional networks. 

The data collected through this census will, in the coming months, become available to download on the Fab Foundation website, along with an annual report that we hope will be useful to both existing and new Fab Labs in support of funding and management efforts.\*The survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete. Keep in mind that this document should only be completed once per Fab Lab, so please coordinate locally in order to avoid duplicate efforts wherever possible.**[Click Here to take the FabCensus](https://goo.gl/forms/pbiuYlOCbP0UPtml1){: target="_blank"}** before April 12, 2019!We really appreciate your time and support in allowing us to better understand and respond to the needs of the network. Thank you for your support! \*All data made publicly available will be completely anonymous. No names or other identifying data will be shared with any person, company or institution for any purpose.
