**The Fab Foundation, with support from Chevron, is pleased to announce the winners of the inaugural Chevron STEM Education Awards, celebrating great educators in Fab Labs around the world.**

First place was awarded to Fab Lab El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA, followed by Fab Lab CEPT Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, FabLat Kids, Latin America and the Carnegie Science Center Fab Lab, Pittsburgh, PA, USA rounded out the winners. The Criteria for the award included exceptional programming that demonstrated innovative methods in teaching STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] subjects utilizing the tools of digital fabrication such as CAD design, 3D Printing and microelectronics.

“We’re thrilled to honor educators and Fab Labs that are working at the forefront of STEM through youth outreach and K-12 programming,” says Sherry Lassiter, President of the Fab Foundation. “We greatly value Chevron’s partnership and leadership in these efforts.”

The Chevron STEM Education Award included cash prizes and recognition at Fab12, the annual meeting of the international Fab Lab Network held this year in Shenzhen, China. There are now over 1,000 Fab Labs around the world making the tools of digital fabrication accessible to everyone. While each Fab Lab has its own focus, there is a wide range of STEM education programing at the facilities in schools, colleges, universities, libraries, museums and innovation centers worldwide.


“Chevron is proud to support the Fab Foundation to recognize Fab educators who demonstrate their commitment to teaching STEM and foster innovation among students,” said Janet Auer, Advisor, Education and Corporate Programs at Chevron. “Chevron is committed to investing in STEM education to encourage students and community members to be the innovators and makers of the future.”
