    orientation: normal
    haslead: true
    lead: "To date most mobile fab labs are assembled inside a trailer and pulled by a heavy duty pick-up truck. As the network grows, so does the definition of mobile labs with machine specific carts, and short-term lending models being piloted."
    hasbody: true
    body: "The mobile Fab Labs have a standard platform which includes the suite of machines, and materials and equipment found in a stationary lab. This includes Laser Cutters, Filtration, ShopBot , MDX-20 Mini Mill, 3 D printers, Laptop Computers, Software (Sketch Up, Rhino, Corel Draw), Large format printer, an Electronics Workbench, Small tools for molding & casting, Molding and casting materials, Silk Screening materials, Documentation tools camera+ accessories), Power and Internet Cables, and Books."

    haslead: true
    lead: "In 2007 a group of curiously creative MIT students got together and developed the first mobile Fab Lab (1.0), their goal was to take the much celebrated course of making (almost) anything on the road."
    hasbody: true
    body: "In 2009 after several years of successful experience in using the Fab Lab at MC 2 STEM high school in Cleveland, the STEM partnership sought and secured funding from the state of Ohio to build the first mobile Fab Lab outside of MIT. In partnership with Lorain County Community College and Max Hayes High School, mobile Fab Lab 2.0 was built. The goal of mobile labs have been to extend the kind of high quality hands on learning in stationary Fab Labs to a greater audience through programming and outreach efforts. Mobile Fab Labs are a growing portfolio with 6 constructed and/or operating across the United States and several in the pipeline for construction. There are also a growing number being built abroad in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and on the Amazon. All customized for the unique user experience of those communities."
