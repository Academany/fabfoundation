      Since 2016, Chevron and the Fab Foundation have partnered to recognize educators that are creating STEM learning opportunities through digital fabrication. To date, we have awarded over $40,000 to formal and informal educators all around the world. This year is a particularly challenging time for educators and their students. Due to the pandemic, over 95% of school-age children are unable to learn in their classrooms with teachers. Instead, they are at home, learning through online virtual classrooms and mailed packets.

      We believe that the best teachers are innovating and finding a way to get quality learning experiences to their students, and we want to acknowledge them with the Teacher Innovator Award. Each week during Teacher Appreciation Month, the Fab Foundation and our partners at Chevron will award an innovative Teacher with $1,000 to continue their work during this pandemic. The Award launches on Tuesday, May 5th.
      Please nominate yourself or a deserving classroom teacher by filling out the form below. If you have any questions about the nomination process, please email us at scopesdf@fabfoundation.org
