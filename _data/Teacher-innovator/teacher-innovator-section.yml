  Since 2016, Chevron and the Fab Foundation have partnered to recognize
  educators that are creating STEM learning opportunities through digital
  fabrication. To date, we have awarded over $40,000 to formal and informal
  educators all around the world. This year is a particularly challenging time
  for educators and their students. Due to the pandemic, over 95% of school-age
  children are unable to learn in their classrooms with teachers. Instead, they
  are at home, learning through online virtual classrooms and mailed packets.
  <p> We believe that the best teachers are innovating and finding a way to get
  quality learning experiences to their students, and we want to acknowledge
  them with the Teacher Innovator Award. Each week during Teacher Appreciation
  Month, the Fab Foundation and our partners at Chevron will award an innovative
  Teacher with $1,000 to continue their work during this pandemic. The Award
  launches on Tuesday, May 5th.</p> <p> Please nominate yourself or a deserving
  classroom teacher by filling out the form below. If you have any questions
  about the nomination process, please email us at scopesdf@fabfoundation.org
