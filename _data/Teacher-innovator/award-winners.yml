          Miranda has made sure that her elementary school students stayed engaged during the time
          they have been at home by enlisting staff to submit videos inspired by
          the hit TV show, The Masked Singer. Students have been able to watch on
          Social Media. She has also incorporated students and staff singing to
          create a music video to share with her school and community, and continually checks in with her students with engaging activities.

          Owen has collected donated computers and refurbished them for the
          purpose of distributing them to students in need of a working
          computer. He delivers the computers to the students' home. He has made
          partnerships with community organizations to get computers at minimum
          cost. Although his teaching position was not considered 'essential' he
          still found a way to make sure students were getting the resources
          needed to be successful during this challenging time.
