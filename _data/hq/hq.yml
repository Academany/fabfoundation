It will celebrate the inventive and creative spirit of the neighborhood and provide local residents and workers of all ages and backgrounds with access to new opportunities. Fab UNION will be a cornerstone for the local creative economy and serve as a catalyst for individual economic mobility."

    body: "The Fab Foundation is seeking to establish its headquarters in Somerville. Fab Foundation is steward for a global network of more than 2,000 digital fabrication labs, or fab labs, in more than 150 countries, all of which bring free access to the tools and processes of technology innovation and personal expression to communities across the world. Fab Union would anchor that stewardship in Union Square, Somerville and would co-create with the Union Square community pathways to success in STEAM education, in manufacturing, in the arts, in sustainable living and production, as well as provide new opportunities for participation in the 21st Century economy. The proposed site for Fab Union is the Union Square Fire Station, a historic building in the center of a vibrant community of 14,000 people from diverse cultures and backgrounds."
