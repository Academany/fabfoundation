      <li><b>How would Union Square and the City of Somerville benefit from the Fab Union project?</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>A historic public building located in Union Square Plaza  is renovated with private sector funds and is activated with community serving uses that complement the Union Square plaza improvements planned by the City.  The ground floor of the building would be renovated to include a cafe, exhibit space and fab lab areas that would be visible and accessible from the public plaza.</li>
          <li>Somerville residents and workers of all ages, backgrounds and abilities gain access to classes, programming and equipment that foster creativity and economic mobility.</li>
          <li>An arts, artisan and maker cornerstone is established in the most central public space in the neighborhood - which delivers on  SomerVision and  Union Square Neighborhood plan goals to foster arts and innovation spaces within the emerging employment district.</li>
          <li>A local hub delivering STEAM programming by and for Somerville community members and a global portal into an international fab lab network of 2,000+ communities.</li>
          </ul>
      <li><b>How does Fab Union fit with the City’s plans for the historic Fire Station?</b></li>
          <ul>
          <li>Fab Union is a response to the Request for Proposal for City of Somerville Solicitation #22-04:
            90-92 Union Square Property Lease and Renovation, submitted to the City of Somerville in September,  2021.   Through the RFP, the City sought a qualified tenant that could lease the building at 90-92 Union Square; occupy the building with an active community serving use; renovate the building to provide long-term protection for the structure and to support the tenant’s use; and provide fiscal benefit to the City.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>What will Fab Foundation do for Union Square?</b></li>
          <ul>
          <li>Fab Foundation will bring STEAM education and arts services and expertise as well as free public access to technology design and fabrication tools to Union Square.   Fab Foundation will also serve as a key convener, connector and exhibitor for local makers and innovators as well as regional and global strategic partners and creative economy participants.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>What roles would Fab Union serve for Fab Foundation?</b></li>
          <ul>
          <li>With Fab Union, Fab Foundation can establish a Flagship Fab Lab that not only serves the local community by providing arts and STEAM educational programs but would also be a leading example of our work to inspire and educate.  Fab Union would also provide Fab Foundation with a small second-floor office space that would serve as its  global headquarters.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>What is US2’s role in Fab Union?</b></li>
          <ul>
          <li>90-92 Union Square, the historic old Fire Station building in the center of Union Square, is in need of substantial renovation resulting from decades of deferred maintenance. Estimates for its renovation start at $4,500,000 and the funds are not currently budgeted.  In order to bring Fab Union to life, US2 (the designated master developer for the Union Square Revitalization project), has offered to  fund the renovation (up to a max) in exchange for Arts and Creative Economy  “credit” for one of its other Union Square development projects.</li>
