  - title: What is a Fab Lab?
    paragraphs:
      - p: >-
          Fab Lab is the educational outreach component of MIT’s Center for Bits
          and Atoms (CBA), an extension of its research into digital fabrication
          and computation. A Fab Lab is a technical prototyping platform for
          innovation and invention, providing stimulus for local
          entrepreneurship. A Fab Lab is also a platform for learning and
          innovation: a place to play, to create, to learn, to mentor, to
          invent. To be a Fab Lab means connecting to a global community of
          learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers and
          innovators- -a knowledge sharing network that spans 30 countries and
          24 time zones. Because all Fab Labs share common tools and processes,
          the program is building a global network, a distributed laboratory for
          research and invention.
      - p: >-
          A Fab Lab is comprised of off-the-shelf, industrial-grade fabrication
          and electronics tools, wrapped in open source software and programs
          written by researchers at MIT’s Center for Bits & Atoms. Currently Fab
          Labs include a laser cutter that makes 2D and 3D structures, a sign
          cutter that plots in copper to make antennas and flex circuits, a
          high-resolution NC milling machine that makes circuit boards and
          precision parts, a large wood router for building furniture and
          housing, and a suite of electronic components and programming tools
          for low-cost, high-speed microcontrollers for on-site rapid circuit
          prototyping. Originally designed for communities as prototyping
          platforms for local entrepreneurship, Fab Labs are increasingly being
          adopted by schools as platforms for project-based, hands-on STEM
          education. Users learn by designing and creating objects of personal
          interest or import. Empowered by the experience of making something
          themselves, they both learn and mentor each other, gaining deep
          knowledge about the machines, the materials, the design process, and
          the engineering that goes into invention and innovation. In
          educational settings, rather than relying on a fixed curriculum,
          learning happens in an authentic, engaging, personal context, one in
          which students go through a cycle of imagination, design, prototyping,
          reflection, and iteration as they find solutions to challenges or
          bring their ideas to life.
      - p: >-
          As support for advanced technical education and to provide a training
          path for new fab lab managers, Fab Academy , an internationally
          distributed campus for technical education, has emerged from the Fab
          Lab program. The Fab Academy provides instruction and supervises
          investigation of mechanisms, applications, and implications of digital
          fabrication.
      - p: >-
          In addition to Fab Academy, SCOPES-DF, fueled by collaboration and
          community, has the power to transform STEM learning in diverse
          educational settings through digital fabrication technologies and
          practices found in a Fab Lab or makerspace. We are building curricular
          frameworks, professional development resources, and evaluation tools
          around digital fabrication that can catalyze STEM learning in the
          classroom. This new platform will enable fabbers, makers and educators
          to collaborate and interact in a Community of Practice and promises to
          expand STEM learning and teaching in fresh new ways. Each partner in
          this collaboration comes with an essential, yet distinct, perspective.
          Together, they can ignite student learning!
      - p: >-
          Fab Labs are closely aligned with MIT’s Center for Bits & Atoms where
          research into next generation tools and software, as well as
          fabrication work flows and processes is pushing up against
          digital-analog boundaries. CBA is charting a research road map that
          traverses the frontier of digital fabrication: from machines in a Fab
          Lab that make things, to machines that make parts of machines, to
          machines that self-reproduce, to building with digital materials, to
          materials that are programmable and can turn themselves into parts. As
          we progress along that research path, knowledge and best practices are
          disseminated throughout the Fab Lab network, making it a cutting edge
          laboratory for R&D.

  - title: What qualifies as a Fab Lab?
    paragraphs:
      - p: >-
          The four qualities and requirements listed below altogether create an
          enabling environment that we call a Fab Lab. If your lab effort meets
          all these criteria,  “Welcome!”  If you feel you are in synchrony with
          the Fab Lab form and spirit, please use our logo in your fundraising
          efforts, and keep us informed of your progress. Please register your
          lab effort or new fab lab on the world map here.   Here are the
          criteria we currently use for defining a Fab Lab:
      - p: >-
          1. First and foremost, public access to the Fab Lab is essential. A
          Fab Lab is about democratizing access to the tools for personal
          expression and invention.  So a Fab Lab must be open to the public for
          free or in-kind service/barter at least part of the time each week,
          that’s essential.
      - p: >-
          2. Fab Labs support and subscribe to the Fab Charter (see below or
          click <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/charter/"
          target="_blank">here</a>)
      - p: >-
          3. Fab Labs have to share a common set of  tools and processes. A
          prototyping facility is not the equivalent of a Fab Lab. A 3D printer
          is not a Fab Lab. The idea is that all the labs can  share knowledge,
          designs, and collaborate across international borders. If I make
          something here in Boston and send you the files and documentation, you
          should be able to reproduce it there, fairly painlessly.  If I walk
          into a Fab Lab in Russia, I should be able to do the same things that
          I can do in Nairobi, Cape Town, Delhi, Amsterdam or Boston Fab Labs.
          The critical machines and materials are identified in this list:
          http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/fab/inv.html and there’s a list of open
          source software and freeware that we use online as well (embedded in
          Fab Academy modules here: http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/ ) But
          essentially it’s the processes and the codes and the capabilities that
          are important. So you want a laser cutter for 2D/3D design and
          fabrication, a high precision milling machine for making circuits and
          molds for casting, a vinyl cutter for making flexible circuits and
          crafts, a fairly sophisticated electronics workbench for prototyping
          circuits and programming microcontrollers, and if you can possibly
          find the funds, you’ll want the large wood routing machine for
          furniture and housing applications.  We are also testing fairly
          inexpensive, but robust and with fair resolution 3D printers—the most
          current favorite is listed in the inventory.
      - p: >-
          4. Fab Labs must  participate in the larger, global Fab Lab  network,
          that is, you can’t isolate yourself.  This is about being part of a
          global, knowledge-sharing community.  The public videoconference is
          one way to do connect. Attending the annual Fab Lab meeting is
          another.   Collaborating and partnering with other labs in the network
          on workshops, challenges or projects is another way.  Participating in
          Fab Academy is yet another way
      - p: Good luck and welcome!!!

      - p: <h3>How can businesses use a fab lab? </h3>
      - p: >-
          Commercial activities can be prototyped and incubated in a fab lab,
          but they must not conflict with other uses, they should grow beyond
          rather than within the lab, and they are expected to benefit the
          inventors, labs, and networks that contribute to their success.

  - title: Setting up a Fab Lab
    paragraphs:
      - p: >-
          You are on the front wave of a new, international movement in personal
          fabrication—and therefore you would be considered an “early adopter.
          The cheapest and fastest method to get a fab lab is to buy  and
          assemble it yourself. This approach does require that you have some
          good expertise on hand to help you set up,  install, debug and train.
          There are a few other ways to get a lab, but they are more expensive
          and require some contractual transactions.
      - p: Here’s the road map
      - p: >-
          The inventory of hardware and materials that we deploy in a full Fab
          Lab can be found <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/a/fabfoundation.org/spreadsheets/d/1U-jcBWOJEjBT5A0N84IUubtcHKMEMtndQPLCkZCkVsU/pub?single=true&gid=0&output=html"
          target=“_blank">here</a>. This is the entire list of equipment, tools
          and consumables for a research grade fab lab.  A fab lab currently
          comprises from $25-$65k in capital equipment and about $15-40k in
          consumables. The open source software or freeware we typically use can
          be found at our <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes"

      - p: >-
          The Fab Foundation can be your one stop shop when setting up a fab
          lab, and we have partners all over the world who can help. While we
          can’t do an over the phone consultation to get you started, we have
          plenty of resources here online. The Fab Foundation here in the US is
          designed to be a resource for purchasing and installing fab labs,
          training managers, sourcing difficult to access fab supplies, general
          fab lab network support, a portal to advanced technical education, and
          eventually  an umbrella for matching funders to communities who want a
          fab lab and meet the network criteria. Let us know your of your
          interest, your application and your location and we can connect you.
          <info@fabfoundation.org>
      - p: >-
          MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms is selectively entering into
          institutional partnerships for fab lab installation, training, and
          research. These agreements fund the development and deployment of
          enabling processes and projects. CBA will also continue to informally
          collaborate on establishing exceptional individual fab lab sites.
      - p: >-
          Outside of formal contractual programs or the network’s Fab Academy
          program for training there is a growing online paragraphs of
          information which addresses many questions, and a growing archive of
          tutorials online.  (http://fab.cba.mit.edu— look under “tools”,
          “classes”, fab lab wiki at http://www.fablab.is/wiki, or the Fab 
          Academy repository at http://academy.cba.mit.edu/labs/index.html) 
          Live help and support from volunteers in the network can be accessed
          through videoconference and our MCU online videoconferencing unit,
          where members hang out during the day and can help one another.   It’s
          free and you can visit once you are set up to do so:
          http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/video. There are also some good experts
          in the network now that you could contact directly to see if they
          would be interested (for a fee) in coming and helping you set up and
          train.  I can connect you to those people if and when the time comes.

  - title: Key strategies when setting up a Fab Lab
    paragraphs:
      - p: >-
          <h3>1. Identify a host agency to host and take ownership of the Fab
          Lab.</h3>
      - p: >-
          The host agency could be any organization ranging from government
          agency, community organization, educational institution etc. The Fab
          Lab needs to be hosted, housed and owned by the right agency to ensure
          success.
      - p: <h3>2. Identify the right champion to lead this Fab Lab.</h3>
      - p: >-
          Very important. The successful Fab Labs are driven by the right
          champions. The champion needs to have passion for community
          development through technology deployment and should be respected by
          the community.
      - p: >-
          <h3>3. Finalize partnership/ contractual agreements Contracts and
          agreements</h3>
      - p: >-
          Including if appropriate Fab Foundation/ MIT, local partners, funders,
          service providers need to be put in place.
      - p: <h3>4. Secure funding for this Fab Lab.</h3>
      - p: >-
          Secure appropriate partnership for this Fab Lab. If you are interested
          in developing a network of fab labs–in South Africa there is a good
          model evolving around Public -Private- Partnership. Government funds
          equipment, host agency funds space, running and management expenses
          and firms pay for projects. Having said that this is a cumbersome
          process. The best would be to find the funder for a first Fab Lab and
          later pursue the SA model. If you get to this point the Fab
          Foundation/ MIT team can assist in budgeting, proposal writing etc.
      - p: <h3>5. Identify and prepare site.</h3>
      - p: >-
          Site selection is critical- in that it should be accessible to the
          community and should not deter potential users.</p>
      - p: '<h3>6. Procure, install and commission the Fab Lab.</h3></li>'
      - p: <h3>7. Train the trainers (technical and management)</h3>
      - p: >-
          Proper training and handing over of the Lab is crucial for the success
          of the Lab. Trainers will be trained to train users and with our help
          you can put together a crash course of ‘How To Make (Almost) Anything’
          with the early users.
      - p: <h3>8. Identify projects.</h3>
      - p: >-
          Starting with local problem solving, the Fab Lab will be integrated
          into the bigger Fab community and will have access to and participate
          in projects worked on globally and in a distributed manner.
      - p: <h3>9. Launch the Fab Lab.</h3>
      - p: >-
          <p>Key community, government and private stakeholders can attend the
          launch to not only understand the Fab Lab concept but also witness the
          demos of project outputs.</p></ul>

  - title: Fab Lab Form
    paragraphs:
      - p: >-
          The lab we’ve been using as an example of the perfect space is the
          Chicago Fab Lab at the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI)—here is
          the pdf of the blueprint  for you to refer to.  The Chicago lab has
          two of each of the machines in it and is about 1900 square feet
          (approximately 177 square meters). For a laboratory with one of each
          machine, 1500 square feet, or 140 square meters should be sufficient.
      - p: >-
          This lab is designed to accommodate larger groups (about 20-30 users
          at a time), so it includes double the number of machines and
          tools—therefore more expensive that the usual Fab Lab . Depending on
          the focus and community of your Fab Lab you might want to design your
          lab similarly.  We can talk through the design together, but even if
          you  want to maintain the standard Fab Lab (one of each machine and
          tool) it would be good to use this layout as a model.
      - p: >-
          Looking at the blueprint, you will see a large circular shape entitled
          Business Enterprise—this is a museum exhibit just outside of the Fab
          Lab so ignore it.  Adjacent to the circle is a semi-circle entitled 
          “design center”.  As 90% of a student or user’s time is spent
          designing on the computer, MSI invested in  a design space for 12
          users, plus a teacher/guru who can demonstrate using a projector  and
          a  powerful laptop computer on the screen at the front of the design
          center. This is also where  videoconferencing  for Fab Academy or
          meetings happens as well.
      - p: >-
          Behind the design center/screen wall is a computer room for IT
          purposes.
      - p: >-
          To the left of the design center there is another semicircular space.
          This is display space for the best or most interesting projects in the
          Fab Lab at the time.
      - p: >-
          To the left and behind the design center is the electronics workbench.
          That includes one set of bench test equipment, but two soldering
          stations and two programming stations (2 computers) and of course,
          electronic components and tools for two labs.
      - p: >-
          Along the back wall are two Modelas for making circuits and molds for
          casting. There is a  computer designated for each Modela.  (2
          computers total here). Also along the back wall are two laser cutters,
          attached to 1 computer, and attached to an outside, roof ventilation
          system.
      - p: >-
          Toward the  end of the back wall is a counter and sink with running
          water to handle casting projects and other projects that require water
          for processing or clean up.   There are two long, empty counters along
          the back wall as well for work space and for use with some of the
          other kinds of tools, like a drill press and a scroll saw.
      - p: >-
          The right end of the lab, in the center of the lab there is  a large
          open space for the ShopBot (large wood router) and the associated
          computer and filter/blower.  This is the one item that has special
          electrical power needs.
      - p: >-
          And finally you will see 2 or 3 large rectangles spanning the center
          of the room. These are purely workspace, places where students and
          users can spread out their projects as they work on them.  Incredibly
          useful.
      - p: >-
          The one aspect of the space that all Fab Labs underestimate is the
          need for material and project storage.  You need some significant
          space devoted to storing large pieces of wood and other materials, as
          well as cubby holes or shelving for student/user individual projects.

          The following will get you fully fab lab ready, in other words, you
          can participate in Fab Academy, research collaborations and all the
          things a full fab lab is capable of doing.   Please note that our
          computing environment is set up as primarily dual boot Windows/Ubuntu
          with most all the workflows in the Linux partition.  We’ve listed here
          Windows-based, propriety software along with the open source and
          freeware that we typically use in fab labs, in case your institution
          or applications require Windows-based applications.  But we believe in
          the open source approach, which aligns with our mission of
          democratizing access to the tools and knowledge for education and
          invention.

  - title: The Community Function
    paragraphs:
      - p: >-
          “Function” is the community application and content of the fab lab.
          We’ve found that the fab lab needs to reflect the interests and needs
          of the community that hosts it. So each fab lab is different, based on
          the community where it resides Below are descriptions of 4 very
          different fab labs and how they function. These labs all try to
          balance financial sustainability with community needs and challenges.
      - p: <h4>1. Soshanguve Fab Lab</h4>
      - p: >-
          This fab lab is in a township in South Africa, just outside of
          Pretoria and is entirely about the community,and the social
          engineering around the community. During a visit several years ago to
          the township, we accidentally ran across a small community health
          center with a printing/resume service attached to it. It was run by a
          group of local youth called the Bright Youth Council, a team of young
          adults from the community who invested the time and fundraising
          capacity to build the Health Center. This amazing team provides both
          champions and gurus for the fab lab there. The print shop next door
          continues to provide printing and resume services (small commercial
          enterprise), but has now dedicated most of its computers to teaching
          children, teens, and adults to use computers and to design on
          computers. This is in essence the design center. Once users have
          designed something that they want to fabricate, they walk next door to
          the fab lab, where a small team of technical gurus helps them learn
          the machines, the electronics and the fabrication processes and
          workflows. This lab has recently expanded their services to assist
          users in prototyping for small business startup ideas. The startup
          prototyping is organized as fee-for-service, as yet unproved, but the
          demand for this kind of help, service and education is large in the
          township. This fab lab also plans to use the digital fabrication
          distributed education program Fab Academy, as an income stream to help
          sustain the fab lab operations. Fab Sosh currently get its funding
          from the CSIR/DST (government) and from large manufacturing companies
          with facilities nearby that are interested in workforce development
          and in corporate social responsibility.
      - p: '<h4>2. Utrecht Fab Lab: Protospace</h4>'
      - p: >-
          This fab lab, located in Utrecht, the Netherlands, is based around
          small businesses and entrepreneurial activities. It is a prototyping
          facility with a social mission as well. Protospace has 2 full time
          designer/fabricators on staff, one full time IT person, a full time
          administrator, plus a part time business manager/fundrasier. 4 days a
          week Protospace provides professional design and fabrication services
          for small businesses for a fee, A few days a week Protospace is open
          to the community for free access to the fab lab. Protospace is about
          50% self sustaining.
      - p: <h4>3. University of Nairobi Science and Technology Park Fab Lab</h4>
      - p: >-
          This lab is about 3 years old and is the first fab lab to be
          integrated into a business incubator environment. It is situated on
          the University campus, but not associated with any one department,
          rather with the new Science and Technology Park initiative coming out
          of the government. The users are local inventors and entrepreneurs as
          well as recent University graduates from engineering. The fab lab is a
          terrific resource for the inventors and students to work on prototypes
          and ideas, and as importantly, to improve upon ideas already in
          process. This lab has about 8-10 small business ideas incubating.
          While only a few ideas originated in the fab lab, all of the inventors
          are improving their designs in the fab lab. The fab lab is also being
          used to train non-university people in advanced technical skills
          through Fab Academy. This lab is successful enough that the government
          wants to invest in a network of fab labs in this same context
          throughout Kenya. An interesting aspect of this lab is the
          relationship with the government, which backs the lab so far as to
          consider policy changes and supports to help it succeed, including
          import tariffs to protect businesses incubating out of the fab lab
          there. This lab is so far, entirely government funded, with plans to
          have the incubator take over financial support in the future.
      - p: <h4>4. MC2STEM High School Fab Lab</h4>
      - p: >-
          This is a formal education fab lab for high school students. Educators
          have put a full fab lab in the center of the specially designed STEM
          school and trained faculty in the skills to run the machines and
          design tools. In turn faculty and the principal have designed
          curriculum that incorporates the fab lab tools and processes in every
          discipline taught at the school (math, science, literature, English,
          history, technology, engineering, foreign languages). They have
          designed 10 capstone modules (each module is 10 weeks in duration)
          that address different overall concepts, and each subject takes both
          the content and fabrication skills into consideration in teaching the
          module. For example Electric Light is one capstone. Students design
          projects around the history of light, the use of light, the speed of
          light, the cultural uses of light, the technology and science of
          light, etc. This fab lab is co-located on a corporate campus (GE
          Lighting Company) such that GE engineers can come and work in the lab
          and help mentor students through projects, and through design,
          engineering and fabrication processes. In turn the students can
          apprentice and/or experience a real engineering environment and work
          with great professional role models for careers in science,
          engineering and technology. This is a public-private partnership
          between the GE Electric Company, the Cleveland public school system,
          with support from private investors.

      - p: '<b>Communities a  FabLab might serve:</b>'
      - p: <li><b>Public school children</b></li>
      - p: <li><b>Private school children</b> </li>
      - p: >-
          <li><b>General public:</b>This group will consist of people who just
          want to make things or learn new skills or make products in the lab.
          This group could include college or university students who will want
          to work in the lab. </li>
      - p: >-
          <li><b>Artists/Crafters:</b>The traditional artisans and crafters
          should be encouraged to come and experiment with the tools and
          processes of the fab lab. The lab doesn’t replace their traditional
          work, but it augments and broadens the palette of what they can do in
          their work.  It would be great to have artists experiment with the
          tools in the fab lab.   Again, an artist in residency program might be
          really interesting—offer several active artists one or two month
          program in which they have access to the entire lab with the technical
          gurus to help support them. If they produce some high level art or
          crafts for exhibit in the lab, and outside in public spaces, this will
          help you show off the capabilities of the lab, get the artists’
          endorsements, and build the fab lab reputation in the public.  You
          might want to sweeten this deal by offering a stipend for the month,
          or to fund the materials they will need for their art work for the
          month, or something along those lines. </li>
      - p: >-
          <li><b>University Students:</b>Always great to have classes and
          students working in the lab.  They can bring great creativity and new
          approaches to making things to the environment. They can also be
          hugely useful as technical resources and as teachers! </li>
      - p: >-
          <li><b>Entrepreneurs:</b>This group includes the college or university
          students, and young entrepreneurs who are inventive and creative and
          need a space and a place and a community to support their invention.
          It might be interesting to have an entrepreneur in residency
          program—offer several active entrepreneurs a one or two month program
          in which they have access to the entire lab with the technical gurus
          to help support them. They can produce some interesting inventions for
          exhibit in the lab, and outside in public spaces, this will help you
          show off the capabilities of the lab, get the entrepreneurs’
          endorsements, and build the fab lab reputation in the public.  You
          might want to sweeten this deal by offering a stipend for the month,
          or to fund the materials they will need for their invention work for
          the month, or something along those lines.  Another approach would be
          to offer a special Inventor his/her own group time in the lab over a
          one year period.  He/she could invite peers, or clients to work in the
          fab lab on special programs for the year. </li>
      - p: >-
          <li><b>Government or Corporate Employees:</b>This might be a group who
          will find new uses for the lab, and new experts to volunteer and work
          in the lab for you, and they will spread the word about the lab to the
          larger community.  Their endorsement  and adoption of the lab can be
          important to the success of the fab lab. </li></ul>
      - p: >-
          You could encourage experimentation and usage of the fab lab in the
          employee community by putting up a contest/challenge for them to use
          the fab lab. Something like– we’ll give a prize of money to the team
          that comes up with the best community project made in the fab lab and
          we (whichever organization is hosting) will help you implement it. 
          For example, making benches for a community park, or desks for a low
          income school, etc
      - p: >-
          If you want to accommodate school groups of approximately 15 to 20
          children per group, you should have two technical/guru support people
          working in the lab.  If you have the extended hours I have outlined
          below, I think you need two shifts each day.   So your staff would
          include:
      - p: >-
          <ul><li>One logistics, planning, outreach and communications manager
          </li>
      - p: >-
          <li>Three to four technical gurus/ support staff for mentoring,
          teaching, maintaining and supervising the use of the equipment. They
          would work two to a shift, with two shifts per day:  8:30- 16:30 and
          13:30 – 21:30. The three hour overlap in time would be used for lab
          maintenance,  professional development and project/group visit
          preparation.</li>
      - p: >-
          <li>One technical manager–  to maintain computers, equipment, network,
          and technical problem solving.</li></ul>
