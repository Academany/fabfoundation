longtext: "SCOPES-DF brings digital fabrication tools and processes to people of all ages, teaching the skills and knowledge of digital fabrication, developing curriculum for formal and informal educational settings, as well as designing and offering professional development training programs for teachers, fab lab managers and other professionals. With the SCOPES-DF project, the Fab Foundation is bringing together fabbers, makers, and educators to deepen our understanding of the “what”, ”how” and “why” of STEM disciplines. <p>The new SCOPES-DF website platform enables fabbers, makers and educators to collaborate and interact in a Community of Practice, and promises to expand STEM learning and teaching in fresh new ways. On our website, you will find digital fabrication lessons, a SCOPES-DF playbook, Fab I Can Statements, and other tools to enhance learning. Each partner in this collaboration comes with an essential, yet distinct, perspective.</p>"
