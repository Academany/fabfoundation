  The global pandemic has affected Fab Lab communities in every way imaginable, but through it all,
  there has been incredible support for one another and for local community
  need. Millions of PPE products have been made and distributed through the Fab Lab
  Network, thousands of designs have been modified and shared, and new
  partnerships have formed as we all try and help each other to stay healthy. While 2020 was a year of  a year of uncertainty and extreme hardship, we are cautiously optimistic  that 2021 will find most of the community in a better place.
