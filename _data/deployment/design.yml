      - p: "After the initial investment, Fab Labs need consumables, materials and human resources. Machine parts need to be maintained and replaced from time to time and projects and their needs evolve. We can help you plan the opening of the lab, but also the following years to make sure you and your users can continue to invent, build and collaborate in a vibrant and sustainable environment."
