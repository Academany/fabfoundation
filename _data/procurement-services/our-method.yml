                Fab Lab is the educational outreach component of MIT’s Center for Bits
                and Atoms (CBA), an extension of its research into digital fabrication
                and computation. A Fab Lab is a technical prototyping platform for
                innovation and invention, providing stimulus for local
                entrepreneurship. A Fab Lab is also a platform for learning and
                innovation: a place to play, to create, to learn, to mentor, to
                invent. To be a Fab Lab means connecting to a global community of
                learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers and
                innovators- -a knowledge sharing network that spans 100 countries and
                24 time zones. Because all Fab Labs share common tools and processes,
                the program is building a global network, a distributed laboratory for
                research and invention.

                The four qualities and requirements listed below altogether create an
                enabling environment that we call a Fab Lab. If your lab effort meets
                all these criteria,  “Welcome!”  If you feel you are in synchrony with
                the Fab Lab form and spirit, please use our logo in your fundraising
                efforts, and keep us informed of your progress. Please register your
                lab effort or new fab lab on the world map here.   Here are the
                criteria we currently use for defining a Fab Lab:

                Fab labs are a global network of local labs, enabling invention by
                providing access to tools for digital fabrication

                You are on the front wave of a new, international movement in personal
                fabrication—and therefore you would be considered an “early adopter.
                The cheapest and fastest method to get a fab lab is to buy  and
                assemble it yourself. This approach does require that you have some
                good expertise on hand to help you set up,  install, debug and train.
                There are a few other ways to get a lab, but they are more expensive
                and require some contractual transactions.

                The Fab Foundation can help you create a Fab Lab for your organization, university, school or community, but does not fund the creation of such labs or it's equipment. We are
                a non-profit organization that offers services and organizes project and programs for the global network but rely on funding or contracts ourselves.
