subtitle: "Dear Fab Lab Community,
The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is rapidly escalating. With more than 2,500,000 refugees on the move in the last few weeks, combined with the brutal tactics of war employed by Putin and the Russian government, this crisis worsens each day.   We stand by and support our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, and denounce the cruel and inhumane war waged on the Ukrainian people and the invasion of their sovereign nation."

longtext: "<p>We have heard from many of you, wanting to find ways to help. First and foremost at this time our concern is the humanitarian crisis, the safety and wellbeing of the Ukrainian people. Later we can support  the rebuilding of their community. For now we are exploring ways to help and will publish them here in the days and weeks to come.</p>
<p>The first fab lab in Ukraine was destroyed in the lead up to Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Since that time,  a network of fab labs and makerspaces  has been established across Ukraine, at least one of which has been destroyed in this war, the others shuttered, and we have not heard from the people who run them.  We are deeply concerned about the loss of life, of home, of the ability to communicate, of the safety and security of our friends and colleagues in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Please contact us at FabUkraine[AT]fabfoundation.org if you have resources and ideas to offer help, or  if you are in Ukraine or any of the neighboring countries that are receiving and hosting refugees and you need the support of the fab lab network.</p>
<p>HOW TO HELP?  We have listed a few ways below, and this list will grow and change frequently.</p>
<p>Fab Foundation and the global community uphold our values of social responsibility, collaboration, sustainability, and democratizing access to the tools and knowledge of technology innovation to improve lives and livelihoods across the world. We are global citizens, working together to build a peaceful, secure and prosperous future for all.  We use these values and this strong network to support Ukraine.
With peace and love in partnership,
The Fab Foundation</p>"
