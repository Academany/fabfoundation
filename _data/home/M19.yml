longtext: "The M19 Collective is a collection of makerspaces, community organisations, foundations, industries, universities, researchers and individuals, to foster a collaborative effort in open innovation, and help combat the current COVID-19 crisis in India.  The Oxokit is an open source oxygen concentrator, allowing for more than one person to use the same oxygen tank at the same time. This initiative is not only saving lives in India, but also building capacity to manufacture locally in a decentralised manner. If you are able, please donate towards this important initiative."
