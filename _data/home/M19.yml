subtitle: "Makers Asylum in India has launched the M19 Collective, a collection of makerspaces, community organisations, foundations, industries, universities, researchers and individuals, to foster a collaborative effort in open innovation, and help combat the current COVID-19 crisis in India. The M19 collective is hoping to activate local communities in India to make 2900 M19 Oxikits, oxygen concentrators allow for more than one person to use the same oxygen tank at the same time. They are using locally sourced parts, building capacity to manufacture & maintain locally in a decentralised manner. If you are able, please donate towards this important initiative."
