longtext: "The M19 Collective is a collection of makerspaces, community organisations, foundations, industries, universities, researchers and individuals, fostering a collaborative effort in open innovation and helping to combat the current COVID-19 crisis in India.  The OxoKit is an open source oxygen concentrator design that allows for more than one person to use the same oxygen tank at the same time. As you may have read,  oxygen tanks are in critically short supply in India.  This initiative is not only saving lives, but also building decentralized manufacturing capacity across the country. If you are able, please donate toward this important initiative to help save lives as well as support local production in communities across India."
