  The global pandemic has affected Fab Lab communities in every way imaginable, but through it all,
  there has been incredible support for one another and for local community
  need. Millions of PPE have been made and distributed through the Fab Lab
  Network, thousands of designs have been modified and shared, and new
  partnerships have formed as we all try and help each other to stay healthy and
  succeed. 2020 was a year of uncertainty and immense hardship, but we are hopeful for the year ahead.
