subtitle: 2020 was a year of uncertainty and immense hardship. The global pandemic has affected Fab Lab communities in every way imaginable, but through it all, there has been incredible support for one another and for local community need. Millions of PPE have been made and distributed through the Fab Lab Network, thousands of designs have been modified and shared, and new partnerships have formed as we all try and help each other to stay healthy and succeed.
