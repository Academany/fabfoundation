longtext: "Since 2016, Chevron and the Fab Foundation have partnered to recognize educators that are creating STEM learning opportunities through digital fabrication.\_This year is a particularly challenging time for educators and their students. To date, we have awarded over\_$40,000 to formal and informal educators all around the world. Due to the pandemic, over 95% of school-age children are unable to learn in their classrooms with teachers.\_ <p> Many teachers are innovating and finding a way to get quality learning experiences to their students, and we want to acknowledge them with the Teacher Innovator Award. We will be accepting submissions throughout the month of May (Teacher Appreciation Month!), beginning May 5. Apply below or find out more.</p>"
