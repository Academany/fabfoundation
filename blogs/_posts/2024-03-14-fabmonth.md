# FAB Month

**A Celebration of the People, Places & Projects of the #FabLabNetwork**

*Read 2 min*

As we continue our mission of bridging the digital divide, growing the #FabLabNetwork and supporting its various initiatives, we are approaching a major milestone in our movement. Over the years, the Fab Lab Conferences have been the only space where community members from across the network have an opportunity to get together and share the current state of their ongoing initiatives through self-organized working groups. To honor the journey and accomplishments of the transformative Fab Lab movement and provide a new space for collaboration, the Fab Foundation has created **Fab Month**. 

Entering the 25th year of [Fab Labs](https://fablabs.io/), we want to acknowledge the projects and initiatives that have withstood the test of time and served as integral pillars in the advancement of the international Fab Lab Network. FAB Month—taking place in our online platform throughout April 2024 with the theme of _People, Places & Projects_—-will highlight the network’s enduring impact on technology, education, and societal development. We will celebrate the resilience and vitality of the Fab Lab movement, showcasing how the many Labs, community members, and initiatives throughout the network have evolved into influential forces driving positive change across the globe. 

As we reflect on the past and look to the future, **FAB Month** reminds us of the collective efforts that have shaped the Fab Lab Network into what it is today and inspires us to continue pushing boundaries and making meaningful contributions to the world. Join us as we recognize the _People, Places & Projects_ that continue to drive innovation and empowerment, within the Fab Lab community and beyond.

We’ve put together a month-long _lineup_* of informative and entertaining online sessions from key initiatives. Below are the dates and times for each. Please, register for any and all sessions that interest you, and join us during April month! *_More session will be added soon_
