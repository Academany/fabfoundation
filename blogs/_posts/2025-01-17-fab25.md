The countdown has officially begun for the 21st annual Fab Lab Conference & Symposium! **FAB25 Czechia [tickets are now available](https://fab25.fabevent.org/tickets){:target="_blank"}.** Get yours soon, and plan to join us **July 4-11, 2025.** 

With hundreds of Fab Labs spread across the continent, it's no secret that Europe has a thriving maker culture. We're excited to harness the knowledge and enthusiasm of this super group of Fabbers next summer as FABx returns to Europe for the first time since 2018. Those of you who had the pleasure of meeting our Czech friends in Puebla during [FAB24](https://fab24.fabevent.org/media/a-look-back-at-fab24-mexico){:target="_blank"} know exactly what kind of energy they bring to the party. And we can’t wait to share the program that they’ve been developing for the big event on their home turf.

The planning team for FAB25 is made of members from two separate organizations—[Fab Lab Brno](https://www.fablabbrno.cz/en/){:target="_blank"} and [Make More](https://www.makemore.cz/){:target="_blank"}. Appropriately, the chosen theme for the event is *Bridge the Gap*—an effort to build lasting interpersonal connections that will nurture digital fabrication and maker culture across Czechia, Europe, and beyond. This means bringing together seasoned Fab Lab experts and newcomers to share best practices; discovering more sustainable ways to use technology; exploring pathways for maker projects to go to market, accelerating the implementation of digital fabrication in traditional education; establishing Fab Labs that serve isolated or under-resourced communities; and ensuring that open-source technology is used in a way that benefits everyone. 

And, in a very literal commitment to *Bridge the Gap* between communities, FAB25 Czechia is being organized as a series of events that will take place across two different cities, with attendees traveling between these locations on a special maker train. Starting in **[Brno](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/){:target="_blank"}**—a city that boasts both a UNESCO heritage designation and a reputation as an innovation hub—participants will gather at the first Fab Lab in Czechia to kick off a week of inspiring activities. From there, a train ride of approximately 2.5 hours will offer guests a chance to network and engage in a unique type of programming on their way to the beautiful Czech capital, **[Prague](https://prague.eu/en/){:target="_blank"}**, where the conference will proceed, drawing on the energy of this vibrant, culturally rich environment. Such a novel approach to the annual FABx Event is guaranteed to result in some unforgettable moments, upping the ante for future conference hosts. (Frankly, this puts the Fab Foundation team in quite a predicament, as we’ll be the first group to follow this impressive act when FABx [returns to Boston](https://fab26.fabevent.org/){:target="_blank"} in the summer of 2026.)

Other aspects of FAB25 Czechia, however, will be more familiar to folks who’ve attended a Fab Lab Conference & Symposium in recent years. The program will feature the same high-quality, dynamic mix of keynotes, panels, lightning talks, theoretical and hands-on workshops, focus groups, and networking opportunities upon which the international Fab Lab Network thrives. And the event will unfold according to the traditional split-day format: In the mornings, participants will gather as a single group in a large venue for thematic symposia (and FABercise, of course!), while afternoons will be customizable, allowing individuals to choose from a range of personalized sessions that suit their interests. FAB25 attendees and the general public will also get to enjoy the beloved Fab Festival, featuring demonstrations, exhibitions, and talks highlighting the myriad possibilities of digital fabrication technologies—along with a Czech beer or two, perhaps.

The Czech team has put considerable time and effort into curating the FAB25 program. Working closely with colleagues across the European Fab Lab network and hosting a series of pre-event meetups to gather input, they’ve established tracks that respond directly to the expressed interests of the broad community:
- Fab Labs: 25 Years & Beyond
- Maker-to-Market
- Digital-Age Competencies
- Emerging Technology

We’re so happy to be collaborating with our colleagues in Czechia. They are thoughtful, meticulous planners with a clear concern for making this an impactful and memorable event for as many people as possible. And we fully expect to see their goals met and exceeded, as the team is fortunate to have the support of a robust network of partners helping to turn the dream of FAB25 Czechia into reality. Huge thanks to all involved!
