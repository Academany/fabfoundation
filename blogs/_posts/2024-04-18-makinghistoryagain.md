# MAKING HISTORY AGAIN

**Announcing the Second HBCU Chevron Fab Lab in the Country**

The sun was shining, spirits were high, and the vibe was festive as Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University kicked off the inauguration of its new Fab Lab in Tallahassee on March 29, 2024. Not to be outdone by their neighbors to the north at Fort Valley State University—who made history just two days prior by launching the very [first HBCU Chevron Fab Lab in the country](https://fabfoundation.org/blog/history-in-the-making)—FAMU opened their ribbon cutting ceremony with a blast of energy, courtesy of a select group from the Marching 100, otherwise known as "the baddest band in the land."

The [Chevron STR<sup>2</sup>EAM Innovation Fab Lab](https://coe.famu.edu/departments-and-centers/fablab/index.php) is the second in a growing network of Chevron Fab Labs placed on HBCU campuses. As the acronym indicates, its scope goes well beyond the exploration of STEM concepts, incorporating science, technology, reading and research, engineering, arts, and mathematics. And, to clearly illustrate that such a broad curricular mix should be part of every learner’s journey, the Lab is located within the College of Education, a departure from most other university-based Fab Labs.

“There couldn't have been a better place to start than right here in the College of Education; this is our original college,” explained FAMU President, Dr. Larry Robinson. “Also, this college has a history of collaborating with all of our other colleges and schools. I think that makes this the ideal location.”

FAMU Provost, Dr. Allyson Watson, elaborated upon that idea. “If I could, I would shout this from the rooftop: Colleges of education need to be at the helm of these types of thinking and acting projects,” the former elementary school teacher expressed enthusiastically. “We are your best thought partners because we work with educators and pre-service teachers every day, asking, ‘What can you do to grab this young person's attention and help them to advance their knowledge by thinking critically?’ We want the world to understand how important and integral educators are to the next generation.”


“I think this is going to be a game changer, not only for our students but the students they teach and people in the community,” predicted Dr. Shawnta Friday-Stroud, Vice President for University Advancement, FAMU Foundation. Having been involved in the project since the original proposal was drafted, her elation at achieving such a significant milestone was palpable. “It is a historic moment, and to think about the impact that it's going to have for generations to come, it's almost mind-blowing. This has planted a seed that, as we continue to fertilize and nurture it, is going to grow, and the fruits of this labor are going to be just tremendous down the road. I’m really, really excited.”

Mirroring her colleagues’ enthusiasm, and sounding very much like a proud parent doting on a beloved child, Dr. Sarah Price, Dean of the College of Education, shared key details of the new facility with the crowd gathered for the inaugural tour that morning. “These Labs can include 3D printers (we have them), laser cutters (we have them), CNC machines (we have them), and electronics (you'll get to see those, too). Our Lab is available to FAMU students, staff, faculty, K-12 schools, and the surrounding community to make amazing things!” 


The Lab also features equipment for woodworking and textiles projects, which, when combined with the other available technology, allows for the possibility of bringing to life almost anything that the mind can imagine. “Just think about the excitement this is going to create in students who will get a chance to come here and experience these wonderful tools to enhance their ability to learn and articulate what they know into real world solutions,” marveled President Robinson. “If I’d had something like this when I was trying to put my experiments together in graduate school, I would have probably gotten a Nobel Prize,” he added with a wry chuckle.

FAMU partnered with the Fab Foundation, Chevron, the CIA, and Dow to make the STR<sup>2</sup>EAM Innovation Fab Lab a reality. With that goal accomplished, attention must now be turned toward developing new partnerships—specifically within the community who will be engaging with the Lab. Dr. David White, Fab Lab Director, and Alejandro González, Fab Lab Manager, are clear-eyed in their commitment to making it a center for innovation whose impact will be felt throughout the region for many years to come. Already, promising relationships are budding around campus, across town, throughout the state, and even over state lines. K-12 schools, FAMU colleges, local universities and nonprofits, and other Fab Labs are all being incorporated into their plan. “Today is literally the first day of going into this new, for us, uncharted territory,” said Alejandro. “The Fab Lab provides the next step because it brings in the whole community. It will be great to see everybody working together, actually building that community.”

Dr. White, who teaches an ‘Introduction to STEM’ course at FAMU, can’t wait to bring his students into the new facility. “This will be the first semester that the Lab is fully open. So, I'm revamping my class; students will now have to do some type of project in there. They can do electronics, fiber arts, laser engraving, 3D printing, textiles, whatever they want to do, but they’ve got to do something in the Lab! Then, I’ll have them write a lesson plan on it. And that lesson plan will be submitted to [SCOPES](https://scopesdf.org/).”


As it happens, our SCOPES-DF Educational Consultant, Abigail McCune, was on site at the grand opening to offer her perspective on the new Fab Lab’s potential. “You can definitely see the drive that the Lab staff has. They’re really dedicated to making this a place for people to come and learn and make and really be their most creative. Teaching people the joy of learning, of becoming a lifelong learner, is so important. Everyone here is committed to that kind of instruction, helping people achieve that lifelong learning goal, which is really big.”


Just a few moments later, J’Lah Hall, a first-year English education scholar at FAMU and Fab Lab intern who’d put forth incredible effort alongside her colleagues to ensure a successful opening day, offered a heartwarming sentiment that drove home Abigail’s point. “Some people make STEM seem like just the hardest thing ever. And the Lab really makes you feel like it's not. It feels good; it feels exciting. I'm gonna be in the Lab until I graduate; I already know. I'm gonna be here forever.”


A world of opportunity has been unveiled on the campus of FAMU and its sister school, Fort Valley State University in Georgia. It’s a privilege to have played a role in the development of these Chevron HBCU Fab Labs, and it’s an absolute joy to see their communities begin to flourish. We feel honored to share a page in the history books with our new partners. But, above all, we’re excited for the future that we’re going to write together.
