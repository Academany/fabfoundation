Washington, D.C. – The Fab Foundation today announced the expansion of a fabrication lab (Fab Lab) in Washington, D.C. made possible by a grant from Chevron that will further spur the creative economy and interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. Fab Lab DC will include updated features and an improved STEM education program which will provide invaluable opportunities for K-12 students and members of the community to design and invent almost anything they can imagine.

Fab Lab DC, a nonprofit, digital fabrication laboratory open to students and the community, works to advance STEM education, human centered design, collaborative projects and the creative economy which relies on innovative solutions to society’s needs.

Last month, President Obama underscored the importance of STEM education in fostering the innovation and entrepreneurship on which the U.S. economy relies. The hands-on learning that will be available at Fab Lab DC is critical in sparking an interest in STEM and preparing individuals for the nearly 1 million U.S. jobs that will require basic STEM literacy over the next five years.

“We are thrilled to partner with Chevron to expand Fab Lab DC’s offerings to the community,” said Fab Foundation President Sherry Lassiter. “This new facility will give students and teachers access to sophisticated technology and together with Chevron, we’ll carry out our shared mission to empower students in the fields of technology, science and engineering through hands-on learning.”

Like the more than 400 facilities in the Fab Lab Network, Fab Lab DC is centered around a suite of digital fabrication tools and prototyping machines such as laser cutters, 3D Printers, vinyl cutters and milling machines, used for “Making (almost) Anything.” It is the second of 10 Fab Labs that Chevron is bringing to areas where the company operates as a result of its strong commitment to communities and STEM education.

“Investing in STEM is a national imperative to create economic growth and prosperity,” said Linda Padon, general manager of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility at Chevron. “Chevron is committed to working with our partners to provide students access to the hands-on learning and technology resources necessary for them to succeed in STEM and become the next generation of innovators.” Chevron has invested $200 million in STEM education worldwide since 2013.

The Fab Foundation supports Fab Labs worldwide in a wide range of projects that foster and accelerate education, innovation, entrepreneurship, business development and community building.
